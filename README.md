Neuromancer is a vim colorscheme compatible with gVim and terminal vim (versions
higher than 7.4). It's inspired by the "High Tech, Low Life" philosophy.

I intend to fully support the following languages:

- [x] Python
- [x] Markdown
- [x] Javascript
- [x] Sass
- [x] HTML
- [x] Vim
- [x] SQL
- [x] Golang
- [x] Typescript
- [x] JSON
- [x] Nginx Config Files
- [x] Makefiles
- [x] Yaml
- [x] Docker

- [ ] Bash
- [ ] Jinja2 (the templating engine)
It's going to be a lot of work, but also a lot of fun.

## Installation instructions

To start using the colorscheme, simply copy it over to your `.vim/colors`
directory. (You can create it if you don't already have it)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zabanaa/neuromancer.vim.git

# Assuming you've cloned the repo in your home directory, just run the following
# command

cp neuromancer.vim/colors/neuromancer.vim ~/.vim/colors/
```
Then, in your .vimrc file, simply change (or add) the `colorscheme` line to the following:
`colorscheme neuromancer`

## Further Notes

For syntax highlighting, I use the following plugins:

* chr4/nginx.vim
* leafgarland/typescript-vim
* pearofducks/ansible.vim
* mxw/vim-jsx
* lifepillar/pgsql.vim
* fatih/vim-go
* mitsuhiko/vim-jinja
* othree/yajs.vim
* othree/es.next.syntax.vim
* othree/javascript-libraries-syntax.vim
* digitaltoad/vim-pug
* tpope/vim-markdown
* hdima/python-syntax

If you use vim-go, you might want to enable the following settings for a better,
enhanced experience:

```bash
# .vimrc

let g:go_highlight_operators    = 1
let g:go_highlight_functions    = 1
let g:go_highlight_methods      = 1
let g:go_highlight_types        = 1
let g:go_highlight_fields       = 1
let g:go_highlight_variable_declarations = 1
let g:go_fmt_command            = "goimports"
```
